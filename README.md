#### 🌱 Projects
Here are a couple of projects I’ve worked on:
- **SwiftAir: Online Flight Booking Platform**  
  Developed for the Indonesian market, this platform covers all aspects of website creation from front-end to back-end. We aimed to make flight selection and booking smooth and secure. I focused on creating a user-friendly interface, managing MySQL databases, and ensuring a bug-free experience.

- **FuelWise: ML-Powered Vehicle Subsidy Eligibility App**  
  This cutting-edge app leverages machine learning to evaluate vehicle compliance for subsidy eligibility. I developed user-friendly interfaces, integrated machine learning models, and ensured our application adhered to strict government regulations.
